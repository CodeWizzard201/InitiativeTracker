# InitiativeTracker
Personal Project for working on an Initiative Tracker for TTRPGs like D&amp;D. Uses Python.  
An initiative tracker allows game masters (GMs) to manage the rolled initiative stat within the combat game state.

Basic Features include:  
-Add combatants to the list.  
-Edit combatants to the list.  
-Remove combatants from the list.  

The next features to add are:  
-A "clear all" button.  
-Allow for the ability to save lists for future use.
