# InitiativeTracker
Personal Project for working on an Initiative Tracker for TTRPGs like D&amp;D. Uses Python.  
An initiative tracker allows game masters (GMs) to manage the rolled initiative stat within the combat game state.

Basic Features include:  
-Add combatants to the list.  
-Edit combatants to the list.  
-Remove combatants from the list.
<br>-Save a list of combatants as a .txt file.
<br>-Load a list of combatants from a .txt file.
<br>-Clear the entire list with a single button.

The next features to add are:  <br>-Toggling the descending and ascending order of the sort (for games that use descending order).
<br>-Improving the UI to be more presentable.
