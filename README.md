# InitiativeTracker
Personal Project for working on an Initiative Tracker for TTRPGs like D&amp;D. Uses Python.  
An initiative tracker allows game masters (GMs) to manage the rolled initiative stat within the combat game state.

Check out the web app version [here!](https://redwizard.pythonanywhere.com/)

### Basic Features include:
-Add combatants to the list.
<br>-Edit combatants to the list.
<be>-Remove combatants from the list.
<br>-Save a list of combatants as a .txt file.
<br>-Load a list of combatants from a .txt file.
<br>-Clear the entire list with a single button.

### How to Use
0). Make sure you can run Python files on your computer first!
<br>1). On the main page click "Code" -> "Download ZIP"
<br>2). Extract the files from the zip and then click on the Initiative Tracker folder
<br>3). Select the Initiative_Tracker.py file and run it with whichever IDE you use. (Later on, I will make a proper executable for the program for better ease of use.) 
<br>4). Enjoy!
